# ESPHID Ducky 8266

## Overview
**ESPHID Ducky 8266** is a Python-based automation tool inspired by the USB Rubber Ducky concept, designed to work with the ESP8266 platform.  
It allows remote execution of automated keyboard and mouse actions on a connected computer via a Flask web interface.

Created by **Dinesh Patra**, this project provides an easy way to trigger HID (Human Interface Device) scripts without directly connecting a traditional USB payload device.
